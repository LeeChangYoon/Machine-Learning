# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning: Basic to MNIST

Before starting ML
==================

Numpy
-----
Numpy is library used in the field of computational science. 
It provides high-performance, multi-dimensional arrays and the tools to handle them

Check Numpy

Objects:

1. We can use numby library.
2. We can understand when to use the numpy.
3. Understand the difference between numpy array and python list.
4. We can create and calculate various shap of matrix (numpy array).
5. We can process the data from files by using numpy.

Pandas
------
Pandas is library for basic data structure, and data analysis.
It allows us to create a data object consisting of a row and column, almost like an Excel.

Check Pandas

Objects:

1. We can install and use pandas library.
2. We can understand when to use pandas.
3. We can understand dataframe.
4. We can create and process dataframe through pandas.
5. We can read data from files and process the data by using pandas.
