# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning: Basic to MNIST

Before starting ML
==================

Numpy
-----
Numpy is library used in the field of computational science. 
It provides high-performance, multi-dimensional arrays and the tools to handle them

Check python_numpy.ipynb

Objects:

1. We can use numby library.
2. We can understand when to use the numpy.
3. Understand the difference between numpy array and python list.
4. We can create and calculate various shap of matrix (numpy array).
5. We can process the data from files by using numpy.

Pandas
------
Pandas is library for basic data structure, and data analysis.
It allows us to create a data object consisting of a row and column, almost like an Excel.

Contents:

1. Import pandas library
2. Creating data frames
3. Previewing Data
4. Sorting
5. Selecting 
6. Selecting / Querting
7. Modify
8. Dummy and Drop
