Machine Learning: from past to present

Before starting ML
==================

Numpy
-----
Numpy is library used in the field of computational science. 
It provides high-performance, multi-dimensional arrays and the tools to handle them

Contents:

1. Import numpy library.
2. Initialize the array, which is matrix.
3. Array indexing, similar to the python list indexing
4. Datatypes.
5. Array Math.
6. Broadcasting

Pandas

Pandas is library for basic data structure, and data analysis.
It allows us to create a data object consisting of a row and column, almost like an Excel.

Contents:

1. Import pandas library
2. Creating data frames
3. Previewing Data
4. Sorting
5. Selecting 
6. Selecting / Querting
7. Modify
8. Dummy and Drop
